# What is our Mission?
Our overall goal is to determine the suitability of a planet for sustaining human life, in the interest of colonising and expanding to other worlds in our galaxy. We wish to create a small probe that will form the first step in humanity's interstellar journey.

## Primary Objective:
Measure air pressure and air temperature as the CanSat descends, in order to determine suitability of the exoplanet for deployment of more advanced equipment.

## Secondary Objective:
Use secondary sensors to assess more factors relating to the likelihood of sustaining human life.
We will measure:
    - UV light intensity using the `LTR390` module, to assess damage to the eyes and skin
    - Magnetic filed strength using the `LSM303AGR` module, to assess dangers from cosmic radiation
    - CO<sub>2</sub> concentration using the `CCS811` module, to assess the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere
    - Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) using the `CCS811` module, to assess the by-products of any pre-existing biological life, and the presence of potentially harmful chemicals in the atmosphere.
    - Humidity using the `BME280` and `BMP280` modules, to assess the levels of H<sub>2</sub>O in the atmosphere
